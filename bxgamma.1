.SH NAME
bxgamma - Alter a monitor's blue gamma correction through the X server

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bxgamma"
[-d \fIdisplay\fP] [-s \fIscreen\fP] [-q] [-v] [-h] [f.f]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B bxgamma
allows X users to query and alter the blue gamma correction of a monitor via
the X video mode extension (XFree86-VidModeExtension).
.PP
Note that \fBbxgamma\fP based on \fBxgamma\fP and xgamma manual says the
\fBxgamma\fP utility is obsolete and deficient, \fBxrandr\fP should be used with
drivers that support the \fBXRandr\fP extension.
.PP
If no value for the gamma correction is given
.B bxgamma
prints the current gamma correction of the display.

This client changes the internal values of the gamma correction for the
Xserver. Whether or not these values are respected depends on the video
drivers.

The gamma values are passed to the Xserver with 3 decimal places of
accuracy.
